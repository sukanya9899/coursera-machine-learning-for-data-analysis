# Week-1
Run a Classification Tree.

You will need to perform a decision tree analysis to test nonlinear relationships among a series of explanatory variables and a binary, categorical response variable.
# Week-2
Run a Random Forest.

You will need to perform a random forest analysis to evaluate the importance of a series of explanatory variables in predicting a binary, categorical response variable.
# Week-3
Run a Lasso Regression Analysis.

Your assignment is to run a lasso regression analysis using k-fold cross validation to identify a subset of predictors from a larger pool of predictor variables that best predicts a quantitative response variable.
# Week-4
Run a k-means cluster analysis.

Your assignment is to run a k-means cluster analysis to identify subgroups of observations in your data set that have similar patterns of response on a set of clustering variables.
